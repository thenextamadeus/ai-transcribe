# This is Echo
A SCAD senior UX Design capstone that uses AI at the core of our product experience. 
*Our repo is messy, scrappy, and barely functions <3 just how we like it.*

Here, we are leveraging AI libraries to: 
> Synthesize radio communications
> Provide response recommendations
> Document everything that happens from initial call to hospital handoff

Watch our marketing @ echoemr on instagram, and find our site @ echoemr.com

Love, 
Amadeus, Ghalib, Nina, Natalie, Avery
