##This is echo
A SCAD senior UX Design capstone that uses AI at the core of our product experience. 

Here, we are leveraging AI libraries to: 
- Synthesize radio communications
- Provide response recommendations
- Document everything that happens from initial call to hospital handoff

Our repo is messy, scrappy, and barely functions <3 just how we like it.

Watch our marketing @ echoemr on instagram, and find our site @ echoemr.com
